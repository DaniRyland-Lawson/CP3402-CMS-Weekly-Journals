Learning Journal Contents
You can choose how you want to write and store your journal - perhaps a GitHub repo or wiki with markdown files or a public OneNote Notebook - as long as you can share a link to the page/entry for each week.

For each week, complete an entry that includes at least the following sections (headings):

Week
Learning Activities
Resources/Links
Estimated Hours
Content Insights
Career/Employability/Learning Insights
The goals of your journal are:

For you to improve your learning processes, self-reflection and focus on developing skills that will make you more employable - both in terms of CMS and generally
For staff to see clear evidence of your learning activities including appropriate "time on task" and thoughtful insights, in order to reward you with the practical marks you deserve for your efforts.
Here are some guidelines:

This is a "learning journal" not just a record of all the things you did in the subject. So, if you spent 3 hours fixing an error or designing a site, you don't put that here. But if while fixing the error, you decided to learn more about the issue through training, then that goes in your learning journal.
Think of this as a useful resource for yourself. If you find a good learning resource, include the link so that weeks later, you can look back in your journal and find it easily again.
The first few sections can be brief, but the last two sections require you to reflect, think and write clearly what your insights were. Use complete sentences and record your insights so that you will understand them when you read them again in a few weeks.
Let's be real. Sometimes you don't get any decent insights. Don't make up stuff (lies) to make it look like you've completed the work. Do you think that's what your company will want?
Examples of fairly poor (part marks) insights might be:

(Content) I revised HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
(Career/Employability/Learning) Lots of videos was boring.

Examples of good (higher marks) insight might be:

(Content) I re-learned that HTML is used for site function/content and CSS is used for form/style - separation of form and function is important for things like maintainability and device-dependent presentation.
(Career/Employability/Learning) I found watching lots of videos bored me quickly. Changing to watching videos for a short time, then practising what I'd just learned kept me much more engaged and I didn't have to keep re-watching videos because I'd drifted off.

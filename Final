Content Insights:
Website is going well. Our group had a few snags with the theme and layout but they have since been resolved. 
My insights into the content side of things.. I believe there was too much contant packed onto the pages. 
Aim is to reduce the content to only needed information. 

Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
This week has been a busy one. For this weeks tasks, it is the important side of the projects. 
This is the time that really tests a team because you are so busy and need to get everything done before the due date. 
Insights of this week include....Our group works really well as a team. I have been able to assist and have jobs Delegated to me.
